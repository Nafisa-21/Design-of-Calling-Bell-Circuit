## Procedure for Making the Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
1. **PCB Design**  
   The circuit was designed in PCB design software and printed on photo paper with the lowest GSM for better accuracy.

2. **Transferring Design to Copper Clad Board (CCB)**  
   The CCB was cut according to the PCB design's size. The printed design was transferred onto the CCB by heating for about 20 minutes, leaving a marked design on the board. Unwanted parts were removed using water.

3. **Etching the CCB**  
   An etching solution made from ferric chloride and hexahydrate was used to remove unwanted copper, ensuring correct current flow paths.

4. **Drilling Component Points**  
   Specific points on the PCB were drilled to attach components, facilitating easy placement and soldering.

5. **Soldering Components**  
   Components were first placed on the PCB, followed by soldering using a soldering iron, lead wire, resin, and a sucker for precision.
